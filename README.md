<h1>Problem Description</h1>




Use a <strong>single-subscripted array</strong> to solve the following problem:  A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.  The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week.  For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000 or a total of $650.  Write a program (using an <strong>array of counters</strong>) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salespersonâ€™s salary is truncated to an integer amount):

<ol>

 <li>$200-$299</li>

 <li>$300-$399</li>

 <li>$400-$499</li>

 <li>$500-$599</li>

 <li>$600-$699</li>

 <li>$700-$799</li>

 <li>$800-$899</li>

 <li>$900-$999</li>

 <li>$1000 and over</li>

</ol>

Summarize the results in tabular format.

You must create 2 separate files for this homework assignment. The <strong><em>Week.h</em></strong> file contains the class <strong><em>Week</em></strong>. The <strong><em>lab4.cpp</em></strong> file contains the main function.

Please see the example on page 300 to 305 in your textbook.
